#### Getting Started with Configurations and Logging

- ❌ The Initializr creates various documents, among them the application.properties file **, which is empty by default**.
- ✅ The Initializr creates various documents, among them the application.properties file.

####	Summary

- ❌ You can also do this via the Spring Boot CLI, a command-line tool, but this is rarely used in practice, so I refer you to the reference documentation at https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/cli.html.

#### PropertyResolver and Environment

- ✅ So the property com.tutego.number-of-seminars is converted to an Integer.

#### Task: Introduction of a Configuration Class

- ❌ The initialization with filesystem = new Filesystem() is important because if you inject a Date4uProperties object and call getTutego().getMinimumFreeDiskSpace() on it, there should be no NullPointerExcep-tion.
- ✅ The initialization with filesystem = new Filesystem() is important because if you inject a Date4uProperties object and call getTutego().**getFilesystem()** on it, there should be no NullPointerException.

#### Search Locations for Configuration Files

- ❌ Resolution: The first file isn’t considered at all because it’s only searched in direct subdirectories of the config directory. The same applies to config/http/s/application.properties be-cause this is too “far away” and is also not read. A look at the list shows that file:/config/*/ has the highest priority, which, in our case, is config/http/application.properties. Consequently, com.tutego.homepage is equal to http://tute.com/. What is normally in application.properties has the weakest priority of all. That is, the entry isn’t considered at all, and everything else is more important.
- ✅ Resolution: We can solve this in two steps. First, we can disregard config/http/s/application.properties because Spring Boot only looks in the immediate subdirectories of the config directory. This means the file is “too deep” and won't be read. The remaining three files are read, but their priority determines which one is used. A closer look reveals that file:/config/*/ has the highest priority, which in our case refers to config/http/application.properties. As a result, com.tutego.homepage will be set to http://tutego.de/. The values in application.properties would have the lowest priority of all.

#### Sort Type

- ❌ The simplest way is to pass the name of the persistent attribute to the of(…) method.
- ✅ The simplest way is to pass the name of the persistent attribute to the **by**(…) method.

#### @Query with JPQL Projection

- ❌  "SELECT p.id A id,p.nickname as nickname FROM Profile p WHERE id=:id"
- ✅  "SELECT p.id A**S** id,p.nickname AS nickname FROM Profile p WHERE id=:id"

#### JpaSort

- ❌ The JpaSort class extends Sort and inherits the of(…) method, so JpaSort.of(…) also returns only one Sort object. It’s important to use the unsafe(…) method.
